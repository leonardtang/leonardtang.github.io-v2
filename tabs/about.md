### **A Little Bit About Me**

Hello, and welcome to my vaguely academic personal site (that's no-doubt quirky and certainly unlike all the other academic sites)!

More seriously, my name is Leonard Tang, and I'm a sophomore(-ish) at Harvard pursuing a joint concentration in Mathematics and Computer Science. I'm currently taking two gap semesters for the Spring and Fall of 2021.

Outside of class, I *attempt* to do research in deep learning. I've been fortunate enough to make a foray into NLP through an incredible research internship experience at [Gamalon](https://gamalon.com/), where I worked directly with CEO Dr. Ben Vigoda on evolutionary programs for low-data structured graph learning. More recently, I've started to further develop my research taste with Dan Hendrycks (the GeLU inventor)/Jacob Steinhardt/Dawn Song at Berkeley.

In the past, I've also worked at Amazon as a Software Engineering Intern and the Center for Brains, Minds, and Machines at MIT as a computational neuroscience research assistant. I'm also currently interning at NVIDIA on the [MagLev](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2018/09/13/how-maglev-speeds-autonomous-vehicles-to-superhuman-levels-of-safety/) team, working on AI Infrastructure for Autonomous Vehicles.

Besides work and research, I'm passionate about guitar (current gear of choice is Breedlove Concert Sunlight for my acoustic & Mexican Strat for my electric), British rock bands, C-pop, lifting, violin, photography (occasionally drone cinematography), and [Datamatch](https://datamatch.me/). 

### **Why this Site?**

This website is meant to serve as a collection of notes, tidbits, projects, and ruminations -- both technical and non-technical, and oftentimes spur-of-the-moment. It is difficult to overstate how useful academic blogs have been in aiding my understanding of complex concepts, and I'd like to imagine that this site might some day pay that debt forward. I hope you're able to dig around -- start looking into the Categories section -- and find something that piques your interest!
